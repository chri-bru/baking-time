# Baking Time

A simple app that fetches recipes from a statically hosted JSON (provided by Udacity) and displays them in a user-friendly UI. The app also provides a homescreen app widget. Recipes can be added to this widget by clicking the star icon on the recipe detail screen. If only one recipe is selected, the list of ingredients is shown in the app widget. If multiple recipes are selected, a list of selected recipes is displayed.
